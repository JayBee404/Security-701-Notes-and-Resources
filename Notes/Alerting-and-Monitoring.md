Log Aggregation - Process of collecting and consolidating log data from various sources into a centralized location  
Alerting - Involves setting up notifications to inform relecant stakeholders when specific events or conditions occur  
Scanning - Involves examining systems, networks, or applications to identify vulnerabilities, configuration issues, or other potential problems  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Vulnerability Scan - Checks for vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applilcations by comparing the system's state against databases of vulnerabilities  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Configuration Scan - Checks for misconfigurations that could impact system performance or security  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Code Scan - Checks the source code of an application for potential issues, such as security vulnerabilities or coding errors  
Reporting - Involves generating summaries or detailed reports based on the collected and analyzed data  
Archiving - Involves storing data for log-term retention and future reference, including organization's log data, performance data, and incident data  
Alert Response and Remediation or Validation - Involves taking appropriate actions in response to alerts and ensuring that the identified issues have been effectively addressed  
Quarantining - Isolating a system, network, or application to prevent the spread of a threat and limit its potential impact  
Alert Tuning - Adjusting alert parameters to reduce errors, false positives, and to improve the overall relevance of the alerts being generated by a given system  

Simple Netowrk Management Protocol (SNMP) - Internet protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior  

Granular SNMP Trap - Sent trap messages get a unique objective identifier to distinguish each message as a unique message being received  
Management Information Base (MIB) - Used to describe the structure of the management data of a device subsystem using a hierarchical namespace containing object identifiers  
Verbose SNMP Trap - SNMP traps may be configured to contain all the information about a given alert or event as a payload  

SIEM - Solution that provides real-time or near-real-time analysis of security alerts that are generated by network hardware and applications  
Agent - Software agent installed on each system, such as a server or workstation, from which the SIEM needs to collect log data  
Agentless - Under this approach, the Siem system directly collects log data from each system using the standard protocols such as SNMP or WMI  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Splunk - Market-leading big data information gathering an analysis tool that can import machine-generated data via a connector or a visibility add-on  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Elastic Stack (ELK) - Collection of free and open-source SIEM tools that provide storage, search, and analysis functions  
&nbsp;&nbsp;ArcSight - SIEM log management and analytics software that can be used for compliance reporting for legislation and regulations like HIPAA, SOX, and PCI DSS  
&nbsp;&nbsp;QRadar - SIEM log management, analytics, and compliance reporting platform created by IBM  
 	
Data Loss Prevention Systems - Used to monitor and control data endpoints, network traffic, and data stored in the cloud to prevent potential data breaches from occuring  
Firewalls - Serve as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network  
Vulnerability Scanners - Tools that identify security weaknesses in a system, including missing patches, incorrect configurations, and other types of known vulnerabilities  

Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) - Open standards that automate vulnerability management, measurement, and policy compliance for systems in an organization  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) - XML schema for describing system security states and querying vulnerability reports and information  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF) - XML schema for developing and auditing best-practice configuration checklists and rules  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Asset Reporting Format (ARF) - XML schema for expressing information about assets and the relationships between assets and reports  
Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) - Scheme for provisioning secure configuration checks across multiple sources  
Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) - Scheme for identifying hardware devices, operating systems, and applications  
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) - List of records where each item contains a unique identifier ysed to describe a publicly known vulnerability  
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) - Used to provide a numerical score to reflect the severity of a given vulnerability  
Benchmark - Set of security configuartion rules for some specific set of products to provide a detailed checklist that can be used to secure systems to a specific baseline  

Full Packet Capture (FPC) - Captures the entire packet, including the header and the payload for all traffic entering and leaving a network  
Flow Analysis - Relies on a flow collector, which records metadata and statistics rather than recording each grame that passes through a network  
NetFlow - A Cisco-develpoed means of reporting network flow info to a structured database  
IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) - Defines traffic flows based on shard packet characteristics  
Zeek - Passively monitors a network like a sniffer, but only logs full packet capture data of potential interest  
Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) - Creates graphs showing traffic flows through the network interfaces of routers and switches by polling the appliances using SNMP  

Single Pane of Glass - A central point of access for all the information, tools, and systems  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining the Requirements - Involves identifying the information, tools, and systems  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Identify and Integrating Data Sources - Involves identifying the data sources that the security team needs to access  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Customizing the Interface - Involves designing the user interface and configuring panels and views to display information and data
