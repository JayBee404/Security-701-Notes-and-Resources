Risk Management - Fundamental process that involves indentifying, analyzing, treating, monitoring, and reporting risks  
Risk Assessment Frequency - Refers to how often the risk assessment process is conducted within an organization  

Ad-Hoc Risk Assessments - Conducted as and when needed, often in response to a specific event or situation that has the potential to introduce new rissks or change the nature of existing risks  
Recurring Risk Assessments - Conducted at regular intervals, such as annually quarterly, or monthly  
One-Time Risk Assessments - Conducted for a specific purpose and are not repeated  
Continuous Risk Assessments - Ongoing moitoring and evaluation of risks  

Risk Identification - Recognizing potential risks that could negatively impact an organization's ability to operate or achieve its objectives  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business Impact Analysis - Process that involves evaluating the potential effects of disruption to an organization's business functions and processes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recovery Time Objective (RTO) - It represents the maximum acceptable length of time that can elapse before the lack of a business function severly impacts the organization  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recovery Point Objective (RPO) = It represents the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) - It rep[resents the average time required to repair a failed component or system  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean Time Between Failures (MBTF) - Represents the average time between failures  

Risk Register/Log - A document detailing identified risks, including their description, impact likelihood, and mitigation strategies  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk Description - Entails identifying and providing a detailed description of the risk  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk Impact - Potential consequences if the risk materializes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk Likelihood/Probability - Chance of a particular risk occuring  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk Outcome - Result of a risk, linked to its impact and likelihood  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk Level/Threshold - Determined by combining the impact and likelihood  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost - Pertains to its financial impact on the project, including potential expenses if it occurs or the cost of risk mitigation  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk Tolerance/Acceptance - Refers to an organization or individual's willingness to deal with uncertainty in pursuit of their goals  
Risk Appetite - Signifies an organization's willingness to embrace or retain specific types and levels of risk to fulfill its strategic goals  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expansionary - Organization is open to taking more risks in the hopes of achieving greater returns  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservative Risk Appetite - Implies that an organization favors less risk, even if it leads to lower returns  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neutral - Signifies a balance between risk and return  
Key Risk Indications (KRIs) - Essential predictive metrics used by organizations to signal risking risk levels in different parts of the enterprise  
Risk Owner - Person or group responsible for managing the risk  

Qualitative Risk Analysis - A method of assessing risks based ontheir potential impact and the likelihood of their occurrence  

Quantitative Risk Analysis - Method of evaluating risk that uses numerical measures  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exposure Factor (EF) - Proportion of an asset that is lost in an event  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) - Monetary value expected to be lost in a single event (Asset value * EF)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annualized Rate of Occurance (ARO) - Estimated frequency with which a threat is expected to occur within a year  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) - Expected annual loss from a risk (SLE * ARO)  

Risk Transference (Risk Sharing) - Involves shifting the risk from the organization to another party  
Contract Indemnity Clause - A contractual agreement where one party agrees to cover the other's harm, liability, or loss stemming from the contract  
Risk Acceptance - Recognizing a risk and choosing to address it when it arises  
Exemption - Provision that grants an exception from a specific rule or requirement  
Risk Avoidance - Strategy of altering plans or approaches to completely eliminate a specific risk  
Risk Mitigation - Implementing measures to decrease the likeligood or impact of a risk  

Risk Monitoring - Involves continuously tracking identified risks, assessing new risks, executing response plance, and evaluating their effectiveness during a project's lifecycle  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residual Risk - Likelihood and impact after implementing mitigation, transference, or acceptance measures on the initial risk  
Risk Reporting - Process of communicating information about risk management activities  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informed Decision-Making - Offer insights for informed decisions on resource allocation, project timelines, and strategic planning  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stakeholder Communication - Assist in setting expectations and showing effective risk management  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulatory Compliance - Demonstrate compliance with these regulations
