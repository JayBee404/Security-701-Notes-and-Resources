Physical Security - Measures taken to protect tangible assets, like buildings, equipment, and people, from harm or unauthorized access  

Bollards - short, sturdy vertical posts designed to control or prevent access by vehicles to an area or structure 
Fences - Barriers that are made of posts, wire, or boards that are erected to enclose a space or separate areas  
Surveillance System - Organized strategy or setup designed to observe and report activities in a given area  
Access Control Vestibule - Double-door system with two electronically controlled doors that ensure only one door is open at any given moment  
Piggybacking - Involves two people, with and without access, entering a secure area  
Tailgating - Occurs whenever an unauthorized person closely follows someone with access without their knowledge or consent  

Brute Force - Attack where access to a system is gained by trying all of the possibilities until breaking through  
Forcible Entry - Act of gaining unauthorized access to a space by physically breaking or bypassing its barriers, such as windows, doors, or fences  
Tampering with Security Devices - Involves manipulating security devices to create new vulnerabilities that can be exploited  
Confronting Security Personnel - Involves the direct confrontation or attack of security personnel  
Ramming a Barier with a Vehicle - Brute force attack that uses a car, truck, or other motorized vehicle to ram into the organization's physical security barriers  

Surveillance Systems - Maintain the security and safety of facilities, including business, home, or commonly used public areas - Organized strategy or setup designed to observe and report activites in a given area  
Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) - Can move the amera or its angle to better detect issues during an intrusion  
Security Guards - Flexible and adaptable forms of surveillance that organizations use  
Lighting - Proper lighting is crucial for conducting effective surveillance using both video and security guards  
Sensors - Devices that detect and respond to external changed in the environment and convert the information into readable signals or data  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infrared Sensors - Detect changes in infrared radiation that is emitted by warm bodies like humans or animals  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressure Sensors - Activate when a specified minimum amount of weight is detected on the sensor that is embedded into the floor or a mat  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microwave Sensors - Detect movement in an area by emitting microwave pulses and measuring their reflection off moving objects  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultrasonic Sensors - Measure the reflection of ultrasonic waves off moving objects  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False Acceptance Rate (FAR) - The rate that the system authenticates a user as valid, even though that person should not have been granted access  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False Rejection Rate (FRR) - Occurs any time the biometrics system denies a user who should have been granted access  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equal Error Rate or Crossover Error Rate - uses a measure of the effectiveness of a given biometrics system to achieve a balance between FAR and FRR
