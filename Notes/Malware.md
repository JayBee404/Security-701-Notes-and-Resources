Malware Exploitation Techniques - Involve methods by which malware infiltrates and ifects targeted systems  

Virus - Malicious code that's run on a machine without the user's knowledge and this allows the code to infect the computer whenever it has been run  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boot Sector Virus - Stored in the first sector of a hard drive and is then loaded into memory whenever the computer boots up  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macro Virus - A from of code that allows a virus to be embedded inside another document so that when that document is opened by the user, the virus is executed  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program Virus - Tries to find executables or application files to infect with their malicious code  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multipartite Virus - A combination of boot sector type virus and program virus  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encrypted Virus - Designed to hide itself from being detected by encrypting its malicious code or payloads to avoid detection by any anticirus software  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plomorphic Virus - Advanced version of an encrypted virus, but instead of just encrypting the contents, it will actually change the cirus's code each time it is executed by altering the decryption module in order for it to evade detection  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metamorphic virus - Able to rewrite itself entirely before it attempts to infect a given file  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steath Virus - Not necessarily a specific type of virus as much as it is a technique used to prevent the virus from being detected by the anti-virus software  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armored Virus - Have a layer of protection to confuse a program or a person who's trying to analyze it  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoax - A form of technical social engineering that attempts to scare end users into taking undesirable action on their system  

Worms - Piece of malicious software, much like a virus, but it can replicate itself without any user interaction  

Trojan - A piece of malicious software that is disguised as a piece of harmless or desirable software  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remote Access Trojan (RAT) - Type of Trojan that is widely used by modern attackers because it provides the attacker with remote control of a victim machine  

Ransomware - Type of malicious software that is designed to block access to a computer system or its data by encrypting it until a ransom is paid to the attacker  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conduct regular (cloud) backups  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Install regular software updates  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing security awareness training  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementing multi-factor authentication  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never pay the ransom  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disconnect the infected system from the network  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notify authorities / check incident response policy  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restore the data from known good backups  

Botnet - Network of compromized computers or devices controlled remotely by malicious actors  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zombie - Name of a compromised computer or device that is part of a botnet and used to perform tasks using remote commands  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Command and Control Node - Responsible for managing and coordinating the activities of other nodes or devices within a network  

Rootkit - Type of software that is designed to gain administrative-level control over a given computer system without being detected  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kernel Mode (ring 0) - Allows a system to control access to things like device drivers, sound card, and monitor  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DLL Injection - Technique used to run arbitrary code within the address space of another process by forcing it to load a dynamic-link library  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shim - Software code that is placed between two components  

Backdoor - Used to bypass the normal security and authentication functions  
Remote Access Trojan - Placed by a threat actor on the computer to help maintain persistent access to that system  
Easter Egg - Insecure coding practice that was used by programmers to provide a joke or a gag gift to the users  
Logic Bomb - Malicious code that's inserted into a program, and will only execute when certain conditions have been met  

Keylogger - Piece of software or hardware that records every single keyustroke that is made on a computer or mobile device  

Spyware - Type of malicious software that is designed to gather and send information about a user or organization  
Bloatware - Any software that comes pre-installed on a new computer or smartphone  
Manually Remove - Use thrid party detection - Perform clean install of OS  

Exploit Technique - Describes the specific method by which malware code infects a target host  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fileless Malware - Used to create a process in the system memory without relying on the local file system of the infected host  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stage 1: Dropper or Dowloader - When a user clicks on a malicious link or opens a malicious file, malware is installed  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropper - Initiates or runs other malware forms within a payload on an infected host  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downloader - Retrieves additional tools after the initial infection facilitated by a dropper  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shellcode - Encompasses lightweight code meant to execute an exploit on a given target  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stage 2: Downloader - Download and install a remote access Trojan to conduct command and control on the victimized system  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actions on Objectives Phase - Threat actors will execute primary objectives to meet core objectives (data exfiltration or file encryption)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concealment - Used to help the threat actor prolong unauthorized access to a system by hiding tracks, erasing log files, and hiding any evidence of malicious activites  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Living off the land" - A strategy adopted by many Advanced Persistent Threats and Criminal organizations - try to exploit the standard system tools to perform intrusions (powershell)  

Indicators of malware attack - Account lockouts - Concurrent session utilization - Blocked content - Impossible travel - Resource consumption - Resource inaccessibility - Out-of-cycle logging - Missing logs - Published or documented attacks
