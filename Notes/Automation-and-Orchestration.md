Automation - Automaitc exevution of tasks without manual involvement  
Orchestration - Coordination of the automated tasks for a specific outcome or workflow  
Playbook - Checklist of actions for specific incident responses  
Runbook - Automated versions of playbooks with human interaction points  

Complexity - Works best in repetitive tasks, ensuring a better return on investment  
Cost - Requires a large upfront initial investment to hire a service provider or a team of developers for implementation 
Single Points of Failure - Identify during automation or orchestration implementation in the network  
Technical Debt - Can accumulate if not regularly maintained or updated - Cost and complexity of poorly implemented software needing future adjustments  
Ongoing Supportability - Long-term supportability is crucial for adapting automation to evolving technology  

Ticket Creation - Involves the automatic generation of tickets when users or customers report issues or requests  
Ticket Escalation - Critical aspect of support ticket management that ensures that complex or high-priority issues are addressed promptly and by the appropriate personnel  
Resource Provisioning - Allocating the necessary tools and resources that new emplyees need to perform their jobs  

Security Automation - Involves use of technology to handle repetitice security tasks and maintain consistent defenses  
Guardrails - Automated safet controls to protect against insecure infrastrcuture configurations  
Security Groups - Act as cloud-based server firewalls that control incoming and outgoing network traffic  
Service Access Management - A crucial area to prioritize in security automation for risk reduction and operational efficiency  
Managing Permissions - Involves ensuring that individuals have the correct access level corresponding to designated role  

Continuours Integration (CI) - Practice in software development where developers merge code changes frequently in one place  
Release - Process of finalizing and preparing new software or updates  
Deployment - Involves automated process of software releases to users  
Continuous Delivery - Maintains deployable code with automation  
Continuous Deployment - Automates the process of deploying code changes from testing to production after completion of the build stage  

Integration - Process of combining different subsystems or components into one comprehensive system to ensure that they function properly together  
Application Programming Interface (API) - Set of rules and protocols that are used for building and integrating application software  
Representational State Transfer (REST) - Architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods and status codes, uniform resource identifiers, and MIME types  
Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) - Protocol that defines a strict standard with a set structure for the message, usually in XML format
