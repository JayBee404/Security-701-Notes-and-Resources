Vulnerability Management - Systematic and ongoing process of identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, and mitigating vulnerabilities  
Analyzing Vulnerabilities -Crucial aspect of cybersecurity and risk management  

Identifying Vulnerabilities - Systematic practice of spotting and categorizing weaknesses in a system, network, or application that could potentially be exploited  
Vulnerability Scanning - Automated method of probing networks, systems, and applications to discover potential vulnerabilities  
Application Security - Used to safeguard the software from being manipulated during its lifecycle  
Static Analysis - Used to analyze an application's source code without executing it  
Dynamic Analysis - Evaluate an application as it is being run to determine if there are any vulnerabilities in the application  
Package Monitoring - Ensures that the libraries and compnents that the application depends on are secure and up-to-date  
Penetration Testing - Used to simulate a real-world attack on a system to evaluate its security  
System and Process Audits - Process that involved conducting a comprehensive review of the information systems, security policies, and procedures  

Threat Intelligence - Continual process used to understand the threats faced by an organizaiton  
Threat Intelligence Feed - Continuous stream of data related to potential or current threats to an organization's security   
Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) - Intelligence that is collected form publicly available sources including reports, forums, news articles, blogs, and social media posts  
Proprietary or Third-Party Feeds - Threat intelligence feeds that are provided by commercial vendors, usually under a subscription service type of business model  
Dark Web - Part of the Internet that is intentionally hidden and is inaccessible through standard web browsers  

Responsible Disclosure - Term used to describe the ethical practice where a security researcher discloses information about vulnerabilities in software, hardware, or online service  
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVS) - System that provides a standardized way to uniqely identify and reference known vulnerabilities in software and hardware  
Exposure Factor (EF) - Used as a quantifiable metric to help a cyberssecurity professional understand the exact percentage of an asset that is likely to be damaged or affected if a particular vulnerability is exploited
Risk Tolerance - Refers to the level of risk that an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives and before action is deemed necessary to mitigate the risk  

Vulnerability Response and Remidiation - Strategies that identify, assess, and address vulnerabilities in a system or network to strengthen an organization's security posture  
Patching - Applying software updates to fix security vulnerabilities  
Purchasing Cybersecurity Insurance Policies - Procuring insurance policies to mitigate financial losses from cyber incidents  
Network Segmentation - Dividing a network into smaller segments for improved security and performance  
Implementing Compensating Controls - Alternative security measures is used for situations where standard controls are not feasible or effective  
Granting Exceptions or Exemptions   
&nbsp;&nbsp;Exception - Temporarily relaces security controls for operational business needs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Exemption - Permanently waives controls for specific reasons such as when using a legacy system  

Vulnerability Reporting - Process of documenting and communicating details about security weaknesses identified in software or systems to the individuals or organizations responsible for addressing the issue  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal Reporting - Involves the identification, documentation, and communication of the organization's vulnerabilities within the organizational structure of the organization  
&nbsp;&nbsp;External Reporting - Involves discussions with the vendors, partners, customers, or the public at large, depending on the specific vulnerability involved  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsible Disclosure Reporting - Art of disclosing vulnerabilities ethically and judiciously to the affected stakeholders before making the announcement to the public at large
