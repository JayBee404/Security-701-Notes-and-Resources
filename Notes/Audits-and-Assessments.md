Audits - Systematic evaluations of an organization's information systems, applications, and security controls  
Assessments - Performing a detailed analysis of an organization's security systems to identify vulnerabiities and risks  
Penetration Testing - Simulated cyber attack against a computer system, network, or web application  

Internal Audit - Systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls, compliance, and integrity of information systems and processes (Data protection, Network sec, Access controls, Incident response)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance - Ensuring that information systems and security practices meet established standards, regulations, and laws  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audit Committee Group of people responsible for supervising the organization's audit and compliance functions  
Internal Assessment - An in-depth analysis to identify and assess potential risks and vulnerabilities in an organization's information systems  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-assessment - Internal review conducted by an organization to gauge its adherence to particular standards or regulations  

Minnesota Counties Intergovernmental Trust (MCIT) - Created a checklist to help members to reduce data and cyber security risks by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities  
Cybersecurity Self-assessment - Helps organizations identify and strengthen data security areas internally  

External Audit - Systematic evaluation carried out by external entities to assess an organization's information systems and controls (Data protection, Network sec, Access controls, Incident response)  
External Assessment - Detailed analysis conducted by independent entities to identify vulnerabilities and risks  
Regulatory Compliance - Objective that organizations aim to reach in adherence to applicable laws, policies, and regulations  
Examination - Comprehensive security infrastructure inspections that are conducted externally  
Independent Third-party Audit - Offers validation of security practices, fostering trust with customers, stakeholders and regulatory authorities  

Penetration Testing - Simulated cyber attack that helps in the assessment of computer systems for exploitable vulnerabilities  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical Pentesting - Testing an organization's physical security through testing locks, access cards, security cameras, and other protective measures  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offensive Pentest - Proactive approach that involves use of attack techniques, akin to real cyber threatsm that seek and exploit system vulnerabilities  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defensive Pentesting - Reactive approach that entails fortifying systems, identifying and addressing attacks, and enhancing incident response times  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrated Pentesting - Combination of aspects of both offensive and defensive testing into a single penetration test  

Reconnaissance - An initial phase where critical information about a target system is gathered to enhance an attack's effectiveness and success  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active - Direct engagement with the target system, offering more information but with a higher detection risk  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passive - Gathering information without direct engagement with the target system, offering lower detection risk but less data  
Known Environment - Detailed target infrastructre information from the organization is received prior to the test  
Partially Known Environment - Involves limited information provided to testers, who may have partial knowledge of the system  
Unknown Environment - Testers receive minimal to no information about the target system  

Metasploit - Multi-purpose computer security and penetration testing framework that encompasses a wide array of powerful tools, enabling the execution of penetration tests  

Attestation - Process that involves the formal validation or confirmation provided by an entity that is used to assert the accuracy and authenticity of specific information  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software Attestation - Involves validating the integrity of software by checking that it hasn't been tampered with or altered maliciously  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardware Attestation - Involves validating the integrity of hardware components  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System Attestation - Involves validating the security posture of a system
