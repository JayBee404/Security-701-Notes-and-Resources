Incident Response Process - Outlines a structured approach to manage and mitigate security incidents effectively  
Incident - Act of violating an explicit or implied security policy  
Incident Response Procedures - Guidelines for handling security incidents  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation - Detection - Analysis - Containment - Eradication - Recovery - Post-incident activity/Lessons learned
Preparation - Involves strengthening systems and networks to resist attacks  
Detection - Identifies security incidents  
Analysis - Involves a thorough examination and evaluation of the incident  
Containment - Limits the incident's impact by securing data and protecting business operations  
Eradication - Starts after containment and aims to remove malicious activity from the system or network  
Recovery - Resotres systems and services to their secure state after an incident  
Post-incident Activity or Lessons Learned - Happens after containment, eradication, and full system recovery  
Root Cause Analysis - Identifies the incident's source and how to prevent it in the future  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Define/scope the incident  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Determine the casual relationships that led to the incident  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Identify an effective solution  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Implement and track the solutions  
Lessons Learned Process - Documents experiences during incidents in a formalized way  
After-action Report - Collects formalized information about what occurred  

Threat Hunting - Cybersecuirty method for finding hidden threats not caught by regular security monitoring  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Establish a Hypothesis - Predicting high-impact, likely events through threat modeling  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Profiling Threat Actors and Activities - Envisioning how potential attackers might intrude and what they aim to achieve  
Advisories and Bulletins - Publishes by vendors and security researches when new TTP (tactics, techniques, procedures) and vulnerabilities are discovered  
Intelligence Fusion and Threat Data - Use SIEM and analysis platforms to spot concerns in the logs and real-world security threats  

Root Cause Analysis - A systematic process to identify the initial source of the incident and how to prevent it from occuring again  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Define the scope of the incident  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Determine the causal relationships  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Identify an effective solution  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Implement and track the solution  

Training - Ensures staff grasp processes and priorities for incident response  
Testing - Practical exercise of incident response procedures  
Tabletop Exercise (TTX) - Exercises simulate incidents within a control framework  
Penetration Test - Simulates network intrusion based on threat scenarios  
Simulation - Replicates real incidents for hands-on experience  

Digital Forensic - Process of investigating and analyzing digital devices and data to uncover evidence for legal purposes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Identification - Ensures the safety of the scene, secures it to prevent any evidence contamination, and determines the scope of the evidence to be collected  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection - Refers to the process of gathering, preserving, and documenting physical or digital evidence in various fields  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order of Volitility - Dictates the sequence in which data sources should be collected and preserved based on their susceptibility to modification or loss - processor cache, memory, swap files, non-volitile storage drives  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect data from the system's memory  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capture data from the system state  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect data from storage devices  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capture network traffic and logs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect remotely stored or archived data  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chain of custody - Documented and verifiable record that tracks the handling, transfer, and preservation of digital evidence from the moment it is collected until it is presented in a court of law  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disk Imagine - Involves creating a bit-by-bit or logical copy of a storage device, preserving its entire content, including deleted files and unallocated space  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File Carving - Focuses on extracting files and data fragments from storage media without relying on the file system  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis - Involves systematically scrutinizing the data to uncover relevant information, such as potential signs of criminal activity, hidden files, timestamps, and user interactions  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporting - Involves documenting the findings, processes, and methodologies used during a digital forensic investigation  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal Hold - Formal notification that instructs employees to preserve all potentially relecant electronic data, documents, and records  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic Discover - Process of identifying, collecting, and producing electronically sotred information during potential legal proceedings  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Acquisition - The method and tools used to create a forensically sound copy of the data from a source device, such as system memroy or a hard disk
